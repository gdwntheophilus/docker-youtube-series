# States of Docker Containers
In this video we will be checking on docker container and its states


### 


``` yaml
created : A container that has been created (e.g. with docker create) but not started
restarting : A container that is in the process of being restarted
running A currently running container
paused : A container whose processes have been paused
exited : A container that ran and completed ( "stopped" in other contexts, although a created container is technically also "stopped" )
dead : A container that the daemon tried and failed to stop ( usually due to a busy device or resource used by the container )
```
